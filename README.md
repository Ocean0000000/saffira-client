## Development

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm start

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm start -- --open
```

## Production

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
